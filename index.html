      <p>From May to October 2014, I hiked all 2667 miles of the <a href="pct.html">Pacific Crest Trail</a> and wrote about my experiences.</p>
      <p>Previously, I was at <a href="inkling.html">Inkling</a> where I led a team of designers and developers in reimagining the textbook in the digital form and worked with publishers to create those books for themselves.</p>
      <p>I was also a designer at <a href="#">Seedling Projects</a> and freelanced under the name <a href="#">Dual Aesthetic</a>. </p>
      <p>I studied at <a href="#">Brown University</a> and took classes at the Rhode Island School of Design. After graduating, I spent five months in <a href="#">Patagonia</a> backpacking and volunteering on organic farms.</p>
      <p>I am a native of the Bay Area.</p>
