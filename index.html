      <p>From May to October 2014, I hiked all 2667 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail.</p>
      <p>Previously, I was at <a href="inkling.html">Inkling</a> where I led a team of designers and developers in reimagining the textbook in the digital form and worked with publishers to create those books for themselves.</p>
      <p>I was also a designer at Seedling Projects and freelanced under the name <a href="http://www.dualaesthetic.com">Dual Aesthetic</a>.</p>
      <p>I studied at Brown University and took classes at the Rhode Island School of Design. After graduating, I spent five months in Patagonia backpacking and volunteering on organic farms.</p>
      <p>I am a native of the Bay Area.</p>
