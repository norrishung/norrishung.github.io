# Norris Hung' Portfolio for 2019

## Installation

```
rvm install ruby-2.5.0
rvm use ruby-2.5.0
gem install bundler
bundle install
jekyll serve

```

## Development

This website can be viewed locally at www.norrishung.com.


## Deployment

In order for this Jekyll site to work with GitHub pages, it must first be rsync'ed to another GitHub repo. This is because we are using a custom Jekyll plugin which GitHub does not support.

Currently, www.norrishung.com is pointed to the [this repo](https://github.com/norrishung/norrishung.github.io)
