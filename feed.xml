    <p>In February 2021, I graduated with honors from the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design. The focus of this program was leveraging emerging science and technology to create concepts that have a positive impact on people and the planet. The program places emphasis on collaboration and rapid prototyping. My final thesis investigated how design could promote rural resiliency against climate change in Central America.</p>

    <p>One factor that drew me to CIID was their focus on life-centered design and the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. Pushing beyond human-centered design, we thought deeply about how our designs would affect the planet and other life on it. This involved theory and practice in speculative design, systems design, biomimicry, design ethics, and circular economies.</p>

    <p>I had little hands-on experience with physical computing, machine learning, and connected devices before CIID but found them to be a natural extension of my interest in programming. I learned a lot about the basics of circuitry, Arduino, machine learning, and different communication protocols. We learned how to create quick physical prototypes with 3D printers, laser cutters, and projection mapping. Combining this with creative coding and conceptual thinking has been a rewarding path of exploration.</p>

I learned how to quickly build trust and go deep with a new set of teammates every week. Each course, we would norm, brainstorm, bodystorm, prototype, shoot/edit videos, present our concept, and reflect. I learned what it takes to create alignment and manage conflicts and I have come to appreciate the richness of discussion and feedback built into the process and see how much a small team can create in a short amount of time.</p>

	<div class="col-md-6">

    <p>Today, rural communities in Central America face many challenges. The combination of degrading soils, changing climate, and falling prices make it harder for traditional smallholder farmers to make ends meet. If we do nothing, it is projected that we will see up to 3.5 million climate migrants in Central America by 2050. Globally, it is projected that we’ll see over 140 million climate migrants in the same timeframe. Smallholding farmers will make up a significant portion of those numbers and perhaps the most vulnerable subgroup.</p>

    <p>However, an emerging farm model that combines regenerative agriculture, specialty products, and ecotourism shows that a brighter future is possible. Because these farms have healthier soil,  richer biodiversity, and healthier crops, they are more resilience to the changing climate. These conditions also allow the farmers to sell their products for higher prices, bring in tourists, and provide educational workshops, all of which provides the farmer with more economic resilience. Perhaps most importantly, the presence of a regenerative farm in a rural community can often inspire others to do the same, reduce brain drain, and change the trajectory of the entire community.</p>

    <p>The program consists of four distinct parts to support entrepreneurs with the most failure-prone parts of the process. The New Seed Accelerator program provides participants with the upfront agricultural and business guidance they need to get the regenerative business off the ground. The New Seed Mobile app helps regenerative farmers to connect and share regenerative strategies and business opportunities with each other. The New Seed Monitoring Kit allows farmers to track key regenerator indicators like soil health, biodiversity, and crop quality over time. And the New Seed Ambassadorship program rewards participants who become regional education hubs with a prestigious certification and consumer recognition.</p>

    <p>The New Seed Society feeds into many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals including no poverty, quality education, decent work, reduced inequalities, sustainable communities, responsible production, climate action, life on land, and partnerships for the goals.</p>

<div class="row">

    <p>Throughout my career, I have been exploring the intersection between design, technology, and socially impactful work. Over the last few years, I have been especially interested in exploring the role that designers can have in addressing climate change. This curiosity is what led me to study at the CIID interaction design programme in Costa Rica in 2020. In the last year, I have had the chance to explore a few projects focused on climate change mitigation (e.g., reducing greenhouse gases).</p>

    <p>However, I always faced an uneasiness while working on these projects in Costa Rica: Central America is responsible for less that 1% of global emissions yet this region is one that will be hit hardest by the impacts of climate change. It occurred to me that in this local context, designing for <em>adaption</em> is be more crucial than designing for <em>mitigation</em>. For that reason, I decided to focus my 9-week final project on the topic of climate adaptation in Central America. Furthermore, I wanted to examine how design could connect different parts of a system to address a systems-based problem. In an intentional effort to push boundaries, I wanted to explore a life-centered solution that’s impact went beyond the direct user, their community, or even humankind in general.</p>

	<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-1">

    <p>For the research part of my project, I conducted in-depth interviews with over 13 participants, including local smallholder farmers and experts in the fields of climate change, climate adaptation, climate migration, and agriculture. I conducted desk research that included scouring through academic literature and reading through a dozen detailed reports. And I also conducted field visits to two different rural communities in Central America.</p>

    <p>Based on numbers projected by the World Bank Groundswell Report and a climate model produced by ProPublica, it is projected that there will be over 3.5 million climate migrants in Central America. Globally, that number swells to 143 million in business-as-usual situations. Smallholding farmers are expected to make up a large portion of this migrants.</p>

    <p>Xiomara, an older Honduran farmer I met, illustrates what this means at a human level. Her and her husband have owned their farm for the last 15 years and primarily grows rice, beans, and corn for themselves. Over the last ten years, she has seen her crop yield drop from 10 loads to 2 loads. She attributes this to degrading soils, less rainfall, and more irregular seasons - observations confirmed by climate experts. The only thing she knows how to do is to keep adding fertilizer to her land but it is costly and crop yields still continue to drop. She expects she will have to abandon the farm in the next few years if the situation continues to get worse. She has no idea where she would go.</p>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">

    <p>When talking to experts about how to help smallholding farmers like Xiomara, the word resiliency often came up. And when it comes to rural resiliency, the field of regenerative agriculture was regularly cited. While farmers can’t do much to reverse the effects of climate change, they can adopt practices that improve soil health, biodiversity, and crop health. This, in turn, can increase their climate and economic resiliency.</p>

    <p>The story of Jorge, another farmer I visited, exemplifies the benefits of the regenerative agriculture model. Jorge was a talented youth who left his community to study tourism at a young age but came back to takeover his parent’s abandoned cacao farm. He revived many of the ancestral practices that his grandparents used and combined it with strategies he learned from online regenerative communities. His farm operates a lot like a rainforest ecosystem and is much more resilient against climate shocks than conventional farms. Because his crops are higher quality, he could transition from selling commodity cacao to specialty markets and supplement his income with farm tours and educational workshops. His farm has also inspired many others around him to do the same.</p>

    <p>However, when I tried to come up with ideas on how to help older traditional farmers like Xiomara to adopt regenerative practices, I found myself confronted by many systemic barriers. Farmers are immediately suspicious of outsiders and it can take years of trust-building to get them to collaborate with you. This is compounded by the fact that you are trying to get them to change an entrenched way of thinking. And lastly, a successful intervention requires deep knowledge of the local context – geographical, environmental, and cultural. This all made a direct intervention with experienced smallholding farmers a non-starter.</p>

    <p>When I started to learn more about how other regenerative farmers got started, I realized they were mainly younger people. They tended to be talented youth who left to study agriculture, tourism, or marketing and came back to their community. Or they were entrepreneurial women from rural women’s groups who tended to look at things more holistically and were trying to gain more independence. It hit me if you could empower these young entrepreneurs to become regenerative farmers, they could act as a bridge to support older or more risk-adverse farmers. This approach skirted around many of the systemic barriers I encountered.</p>

    <p>All of this lead to me to my initial concept direction - how do we help more rural entrepreneurs to successfully start their own regenerative businesses so that they can become a bridge to create more resilient rural communities?</p>

    <p>With a clear concept direction, I set out to bring life to my idea. In summary, I led two brainstorming sessions with classmates, visited two rural communities, co-created with six farmers and five subject matter experts, and conducted three usability testing sessions.
In an effort to generate as many ideas as possible, I recruited my classmates for a group brainstorming session. Because the subject matter was quite different from their backgrounds, I decided to conduct a narrative brainstorming session where I had them first read a day-in-the-life story of a farmer in order to help them to better empathize.</p>

    <p>From these brainstormings, the concept of an accelerator program was born. I went out to test whether the idea of an accelerator was interesting and was met with a lot of positive feedback from both farmers and subject matter experts about this general direction.</p>

    <p>With this validation, I flushed out the initial touch points and generated more ideas with classmates through brainstorming sessions around specific touch points. With many ideas now in mind, the clear next step was to validate with farmers and subject matter experts which ideas actually resonated. Through card sorts, field visits, and in-depth interviews, I developed a much clearer sense of the struggles that regenerative farmers faced faced early on and what type of support would be most useful in helping them to be successful.</p>

    <p>I learned that sharing the stories of existing regenerative entrepreneurs was the best way to help inspire young people to visualize themselves going down the same path. I learned early on that access to land, loans, and specialty business connections were the crucial factors. I learned that providing a foundational regenerative agriculture framework is important to successful implementation of regenerative strategies. I learned that, in the first few years of building a regenerative farm, there is an intense phase of trial and error that requires lots of support. I learned that leveraging ancestral craft from older farmers in the region was the most useful resource and learning from the experimentation of other regenerative farmers in similar regions was a close second.</p>

    <p>Lastly, I learned that without collaboration with research institutes, the emerging field of regenerative agriculture would never receive the institutional support from companies, government, and funders to truly take off. Widespread adoption of a regenerative agriculture program would require proper evaluation.</p>

    <p>From these co-creation insights, I came up with the four touch points in my final concept - the accelerator program, the mobile app, the monitoring kit, and the ambassadorship program. I designed higher fidelity versions of my touch points and brought them back out into the field for usability testing and feedback.</p>

    <p>From these higher fidelity usability testing sessions, I learned that videos were the best medium for sharing problems and solutions. I learned metadata such altitude, soil type, temperature range, and humidity range helped farmers to know whether a specific strategy would work for their region. I learned that providing contact information for suppliers of specific seeds or other input materials removes a key barrier to adopting a new practice. I learned that certification offers a clear set of guidelines that could incentive farmers to work with their community and pay back loans. And I learned about other governmental, non-profit, and research institutions in the region could be potential collaboration partners.</p>

    <p>These final adjustments led me to my final iteration of the New Seed Society.</p>

    <p>At the end, I was able to gather feedback from various farmers and subject matter experts. I was pleased to receive quite positive feedback from many people in the local context. I had a handful young potential rural entrepreneurs ask me if this was a real program and if they could join after watching the video. And lastly, I received an email from the Coffee Institute of Costa Rica stating, “We are currently working on launching a project focused on supporting youth in coffee farmers through technology and education, and I think your project really aligns with what we are thinking… We would love to explore opportunities to see how we could scale it up.”</p>

    <p>Given the genuine interest and local engagement, I am looking into opportunities to bring this short 9-week project to life. My immediate steps would be to continue to meeting with local stakeholders and farmers to iterate on the touch points. I would also likely start out by bootstrapping these concepts with existing technologies during the pilot year in order to learn more about touch points and features that would really resonate.</p>

    <p>Throughout the project, my goal to combine empathic research, thoughtful design, appropriate technology, and high level climate goals to achieve a result that could truly change the lives of people at their most vulnerable. I hope that the current state and future iterations of this project will live up to that ideal.</p>

    <p>Tic@Tide is an unconventional time device based on the tidal forces and wave patterns of the ocean. It is a reminder to follow the pace of nature and to enjoy life.</p>

    <p>The clock is tied to a local buoy which collects real-time data about tide height and wave frequency. This clock visualizes tide height through the color and intensity of the light. The stronger and more saturated the blue color, the higher the tide. The movement of the light across a series of bent acrylic plates represent the frequency and velocity of waves at the time.</p>

    <p>Some of the themes that were explored through this concept included:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>short-term vs long-term engagement (representation of waves vs tides)</li>
      <li>representation of different “emotional” states of the ocean (tranquility of low-tide vs violence of high-tide)</li>
      <li>natural vs artificial rhythms (tide time vs numerical time)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This prototype was built with an Arduino Nano and a NeoPixel matrix over the course of two days during the Connected Objects course. Tidal data was provided by the NOAA.gov api through on-board Wi-Fi and a PubNub server.</p>

    <p>Sensing Time is an installation piece that allows people to adjust their perception of time in order to better empathize with other organisms and planetary events.</p>

    <p>This project was created as a 24-hour project in collaboration with Herin Haramoto, Julian Jimsa, and Maria Jose Tamayo as part of the Designing Sensing course during the CIID Interaction Design Programme in 2020. As the brief, we were asked to imagine how technology could augment human senses in order to better sense our planet in the face of climate change.</p>

<h2 id="technology-and-evolution">Technology and Evolution</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">

    <p>When considering how technology might be used to augment our senses in the future, we first explored how senses have evolved in the past. Since the beginning, sensory organs in all creatures have been pushed to evolve based on the specific environmental pressures they face. Dogs developed a strong sense of smell and birds developed sharper vision because it helped them to survive given their environmental context.</p>

    <p>While this is undoubtedly useful, the velocity at which a species can evolve biologically is limited by how quickly genetics can mutate through successive reproductive generations. However, evolutional psychologist Stephen Pinker provides a theory for how humans have been able to augment biological evolution through a phenomenon that he calls the “cognitive niche.” Essentially, through the use of reasoning, technology, and collaboration, humans have been able to overcome fixed evolutionary defenses of other organisms thus allowing us to increase our survival rate.</p>

    <p>A modern and commonly cited example of this is the invention of the bicycle. While humans are innately one of the least energy efficient animals when it comes to transportation, a human on a bicycle easily outcompetes everything else.</p>

    <p>Over the last few thousand years, the competitive advantage of humans over other species has moved the Earth into a new geological epoch referred to as the Anthropocene, in which human activity has a significant impact on the Earth’s geology and ecosystems. Because of this, the environmental pressures that humans face today look very different than before.</p>

    <p>Over the long term, our species’ survival depends less on our ability to perceive and act on our immediate environment and more on our ability to perceive and act on a planetary scale. It appears, however, that much of the horrifying stimulus that might push us to action - global warming, glacial melt, mass extinction, ecosystem collapse  - happen so slowly that our senses cannot detect them. Without the ability to perceive, our instinct to act is deadened.</p>

When brainstorming how we might augment our perception, we found inspiration under the annals of film and camera. We found existing timelapse and slow motion videos that captured the speed of nature in a way that brought invisible rhythms and events to life. We explored the use of different sensors and inputs to bring those images to life. And we are especially inspired by Ray and Charles Eames' documentary film "Powers of Ten" in it's abilities to help people perceive different spatial scales.

    <p>The device allows someone to slow down and speed up time on the objects in the frame by moving the device forwards and backwards. By moving the device backwards, one may clearly see the individual flaps of a bee’s wing. By moving the device forwards, one can see the “rhythm of breathing” of a glacier over decades.</p>

    <p>By moving non-human rhythms closer to the speed of “human rhythm”, the hope is that we can more instinctively empathize with non-human phenomena.</p>

    <p>Climate change has always been an issue that I’ve felt like I should be doing more about. In the past, I would often get my information from friends or the news about something I should be doing more or less of. But with such a complex problem and the prevalence of greenwashing, I never knew if the changes I made actually mattered. During my year studying at CIID, I decided this was a good time to really dive deep into primary literature and science about climate change.</p>

    <p>During the three weeks of the GUI course during the CIID Interaction Design Programme in 2020, we were asked to design an interactive narrative about a topic of our choice. This seemed like a great opportunity to synthesize a lot of my learnings over the last year.</p>

    <p>For this project, much of the primary science came from the IPCC Global Warming of 1.5°C Report. The Project Drawdown 2020 Review and Saul Griffith’s Rewiring America Handbook provided great frameworks on systems-based solutions. “The Future We Choose” by Christiana Figueres provided a lot of the initial inspiration around meaningful individual climate actions. Francesca Desmarais, a climate designer in the CIID network, provided guidance throughout the project.</p>

    <p>Net Zero is a mobile app concept that combines guided learning and behavioral nudges to help users take individual action and see how they fit into the bigger picture. The mobile app provides its user with three main pillars of information – content, solutions, and actions – bookended by an onboarding section and a user profile section.</p>

    <p>In order to nudge a user to action, it uses behavioral strategies such as social proof and choice simplification to address common cognitive biases such as hassle factor and choice paralysis.</p>

    <p><strong>Onboarding Narrative</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Context</strong></p>

    <p>This section provides the basic context and science around climate change. It provides information on different greenhouse gas emissions, their effect on warming, and how much certain human activities contribute to global emissions. The goal is to provide a quantitative sense of the big picture.</p>

    <p>An introduction narrative provides an entry point and framing for this section. The user can then freely explore emissions by source or greenhouse gases type to learn more about each.</p>

    <p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>

    <p>If the previous section offered scientific context on the problem space of global warming, this section provides the climate science community’s latest understand of the solution space. The goal is to provide the user with a sense of all of the changes that society would need to make and how much each change contributes to reaching net zero emissions.</p>

    <p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

    <p>While the previous two sections provides the education for what likely needs to happen on a societal scale to address climate change, this section provides actionable steps an individual can take that ladder up to those societal changes. Some of them relate to a specific solution or economic sector of emission (e.g., eating 5 meatless meals a week contributes to the solution space of “plant-based diets” and the problem space of “Food, Agriculture, and Land-use”). Others are accelerators to pave the way for systemic change across multiple solutions (e.g., writing a letter to your congress person).</p>

By inputting a few pieces of personal information, actions can be tailored to your location, skills, or resources. You can commit to specific climate actions and share your commitments with friends to build social accountability.</p>

    <p>Limited Memory is an audio recording device which requires users to be more intentional about the memories they keep and the ones they let go of. The device stores up to three audio recordings of three minutes that degrade over time unless the user chooses to ‘sustain’ the memory by playing the recording or let go replacing it with a new recording.</p>

    <p>The goal of Limited Memory is to challenge our reliance on digital storage to help retrieve the past, encourage people to process their memories, and explore the idea of memory degradation over time.</p>

    <p>This was the result of 1-week group project with Aakash Dewan, Julian Jimsa, and Diana Pang for the physical computing course during the CIID Interaction Design Programme in 2020. The design brief was to “reinvent an ordinary object by reimagining its existing interactivity that considers a beyond-the-user scale.” While we loosely followed a design process that involved research, brainstorming, prototyping, and iteration, we also allowed the process to take a more artistic path for this project.</p>

    <p>When we think of augmented reality, a futuristic image often appears of smart glasses, wrist-based devices, and wild hand gestures. However, technological augmentation of reality has already been quietly evolving in our pockets over the last decade. Data like phone numbers, birthdays, and todo lists that used to be stored in our minds are now relegate to SDDs in our smartphones. By transferring responsibility of this data to an external device, we free up brainpower to use on more important things.</p>

    <p>As we explored further down this path, we began to wonder what are the consequences of exporting data that is more personal, like memories, to our smartphones?</p>

    <p>Today, we essentially have a limitless amount of storage for our photos and videos. We anxiously snap photos of every potentially special moment and refuse to delete even the most seemingly insignificant photo. The past is instantly retrievable but it begs the question: is this version of the past still meaningful? Is this refusal to let go of memories healthy? What consequences will this have when scaled up to a society?</p>

    <p>During the process of working on this project, we explored many different themes as a group.</p>

    <p><strong>Scarcity, physicality, and preciousness</strong></p>

    <p>This theme initially emerged through discussions as our changing relationship with music. We talked about the preciousness of owning records -  because they were tangible, because you only had access to a small amount of songs, and because records would deteriorate over time, this made society’s relationship with music inherently more meaningful. While streaming services today offer an unlimited library and convenience, our relationship with music has become more shallow as a result. Might our relationship with our own memories share a parallel narrative?</p>

    <p><strong>Rituals, passage of time, processing emotions</strong></p>

    <p>Another topic of discussion was the importance of rituals in our lives. Rituals often play a role in the demarcation of time but, perhaps more importantly, they help us process time and big ideas. Graduations, weddings, baby showers, housewarmings – rituals such as these help us mark the passage from one phase of life to another. They give us an opportunity reflect on a previous identity and to embrace a new one.</p>

    <p><strong>Memory degradation, reinforcement, fictions of the past</strong></p>

    <p>The last crucial theme explored during this topic is the malleability of memory. Unlike the videos, photos, and audio recordings stored in our phone, the memories in our minds are not static. If we do not revisit the memories every so often, the connections in our brain that make up that memory weaken. On the other hand, every time we revisit a memory, specific moments can be exaggerated or changed.  Our memory is not the same as the past, it is, as they say, a fictional story inspired by true events.</p>

    <p>Limited Memory is a provokatype that pushes us to think about our relationship both with technology and our own memories. Instead of unlimited storage, what if we only had 9MB to store our memories? Which memories would you keep and what would you let go of? Would it change how you ritualize and process your memories?</p>

    <p>We wanted a form that invoked a theme of nostalgia and memories and is inspired by old-time radios and cassette players. There are two main components to Limited Memory: the memory cassettes and the memory player.</p>

    <p><strong>Memory Cassettes</strong></p>

    <p>Memory cassettes allow you to record memories on the go but only up to 3 minutes each. You can raise the antenna to record audio and lower it to stop recording. A red light indicates the record state and a glow through the acrylic panel indicates the presence of a memory.</p>

    <p>Much like tape cassettes, the memories in the cassette will degrade over time. However unlike tapes, memory will degrade if left alone and and only regenerate when you listen to them.</p>

    <p><strong>Memory Player</strong></p>

    <p>The memory player can hold up to three memory cassettes. It has a dedicated play spot that allows you to play or let go of a specific memory. By playing a memory cassette, it revives the memory inside it to full clarity. By letting go of a memory, you can free up space for a new memory. However, you are forced to listen to the memory one last time as both the audio and light fade away.</p>

    <p>We started off by agreeing on a general direction for the project and doing extensive desk research around the subject of technology, memory, and rituals. From there, we shared what we found as inspiration for continued discussion and brainstorming.</p>

    <p>After a few rounds of visual brainstorming, we landed on the general direction of a device to store and let go of memories. In its original conception, the idea was much more complex and convoluted. It involved being able to store one memory per day, seven memories a week, four a month, twelve a year, and ten per decade. The memories could be stored as photos, videos, or audio.</p>

    <p>After a few rounds of visual brainstorming, we dramatically simplified the idea to three memories of three minutes of audio each. We liked how much the constraint clarified the power of the idea.</p>

    <p>From there, we aligned on the core interactions of the device and relied on bodystorming to decide what each interaction could look like. From there, the form of the device started to emerge. We explored a few different directions before landing on something similar to what we ended up with.</p>

    <p>We had two initial prototypes - one for form and another for function. We split up into pairs to work on each separately. Julian and I worked on the Arduino circuitry while Aakash and Diana worked on getting the form right. We started off by aligning on what our state machine would look like. Then we built the circuit and coded the programming feature by feature until every interaction was flushed out.</p>

    <p>Inevitably, we ran into many problems along the way, including trying to debug third-party MP3 shields with paid PDFs of decade-old Australian DIY magazines. Risky experiments like this were time-boxed and when they didn’t work out, we fell back to doing audio processing on a connected laptop with p5.js.</p>

    <p>When both of the form and function prototypes were flushed out, we created our third and final prototype to merge the two together. The final prototype was composed of a base station and three recording boxes. The base station prototype was built with wood panels, an Arduino Uno, speaker, and two buttons. The recording box prototype was built with wood and acrylic panels, a 3D-printed antenna, an Arduino Nano 33 IoT, NeoPixel LED strip, a photoresistor, and recording LED. A laptop running p5 recorded the sounds and facilitated communication between separate devices through bluetooth and serial connections.</p>

    <p>This project was highlighted by Arduino’s official website and instagram account.</p>

    <p>In 2018, Jerry Brown, then out-going governor of California, signed legislation that opened up CalFresh (food stamps) to over 500,000 low-income seniors and people with disabilities.</p>

    <p>When the State of California asked us to provide the official online service for CalFresh enrollment, we wanted to ensure that our service, GetCalFresh, would be ready to receive the influx of newly eligible applicants. We knew our clients’ access to food depended on our ability to get it right.</p>

    <p>It can be easy to be caught up in “accessibility theater” by meeting a general checklist of criteria without understanding if it holds up in real situations. To ensure GetCalFresh was truly accessible, we took an approach that we think is key to doing anything well:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Take time to develop true care and understanding</li>
      <li>Find ways to meaningfully improve our service</li>

    <p>It was also important to recognize when to build on work of others. In addition to conducing primary research, we sought guidance from the established community of practice around accessibility.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>We conducted an accessibility audit with a non-profit organization called Knowbility. We picked them because of their mission alignment and because they had people with disabilities as part of their team.</li>
      <li>We reviewed accessibility guidelines from other well-respected organizations such as W3C, GDS, and 18F.</li>

By the end of our research phase, we felt like like we had a reasonable grasp what we were working with. 

A lot of our work was catching up to speed with the larger community of practice. We learned the difference between situational, temporary, or permanent disabilities and how accessibility benefits everyone. We learned the well-understood norms of how to make a product that accessible to this with visual or physical impairments.

    <p>Inspired by golden proportions, we defined a sizing system that would be used to define everything else in our design system including typography, patterns, and layout. This provided an easy to understand system for designers and engineers alike to ensure a clear and consistent hierarchy.</p>

    <p>Many of our older clients did not intuitively know to scroll. We added a conditional scrolling indicator that only showed up if we did not detect scrolling after a few seconds (and would disappear once they did).

    <p>A simple yet valuable insight we had was that that seniors and people with disabilities do not exist in a vacuum. More often than not, you’ll find a wide network of helpers who assist them with their needs. This could be an adult child or sibling who cares for and represents them, an IHSS (In Home Supportive Services) worker who helps their perform daily activities, or the lobbyist at the senior home that connect them with services.</p>

    <p>On June 1st, 2019, CalFresh opened up to the 1.3 million people who lived on Supplementary Security Income in California. Our service experienced a five-fold increase in the number of applications coming in that week. As of August 2019, we have helped over 200,000 SSI recipients apply for CalFresh. Our rate of completion and satisfaction remain steady.</p>

    <p>Over the last few months, we have developed a much deeper understanding of accessibility at Code for America. We have helped others in the organization understand why accessibility is important in the real world and made it easier incorporate accessibility into their work.</p>

    <p>Of course, our work remains unfinished. The last key point to doing accessibility well is to remember that your work is never done. Even at this moment, we are continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of our work through surveys and continued usability testing. We have a long way to go to get our copywriting down to a 5th grade reading level. We plan on deepening our understanding of true accessibility by partnering with Lighthouse Labs and working directly with more people who are vision-impaired. Our understanding of how to better serve and collect feedback from people with cognitive disabilities is still painfully low.</p>

    <p>There will always be new additional challenges to tackle and biases to uncover. We are excited to keep our users at the center and push the envelope for what it means to be truly accessible.</p>

    <p>In the 1930’s, a group of young unknown designers had an idea for a better chair. They imagined a sturdy singular form shaped to fit the human body. By doing this, they hoped to create something comfortable without the need of a cushion. Perhaps equally as important, by simplifying the construction of a chair, they sought to make something great and affordable for everyone. Or in their words:</p>

    <p>While these designers hoped to continue making furniture, the times demanded other priorities. The year was 1941, America entered the Second World War and this group of designers received their first large commission: making leg splints for wounded soldiers. They saw an opportunity here to perform their civic duty and also to perfect their craft of molding plywood. They learned by placing strategic cut-outs in the wood, you could reduce the strain placed on the wood, enabling a wider variety of shapes. Over the course of a few years, they were able to manufacture hundreds of thousands of splints. When the war ended, they went back to the drawing board and sought to design a chair with their newfound experience. The learnings from the original chair helped them to design an innovative leg splint. In turn, the learnings from the leg splint helped them to design a better chair. This was another important lesson for them.</p>

    <p>In 1951, they released their fiberglass shell chair to the world for $20 a pop. By doing the hard work of making something simple, they were finally able to make the best for the most for the least.  Today, the shell chair is ubiquitous. It’s everywhere from homes to schools to offices to airports.</p>

    <p>As some of you might have figured out, the designers were none other than Ray and Charles Eames. As a wife and husband team, they oversaw a group of talented designers. This chair marked the beginning of an incredibly creative and prolific studio. They ended up working on everything from furniture to buildings to toys to documentaries to museum exhibits. Learning about how they worked opened up my eyes to what a truly innovative design process looked like. Unfortunately, because of their fame, this chair isn’t quite so cheap anymore but it certainly was at the time.</p>

    <p>In 2015, three former CfA fellows studied the experience of being on food stamps and realized if they wanted to increase the participation rate, the enrollment process would have to be fixed. As a result, they partnered with government in California to prototype a new CalFresh application.</p>

    <p>After the success of an initial prototype, I was brought on as the first designer on the team. We decided to focus on diving deeper into the specific barriers that clients were facing.</p>

    <p>From 2017-2018, the GetCalFresh team combined qualitative and quantitative research to understand the barriers Californians faced as they applied for CalFresh (food stamps). Based on what we learned, we redesigned the application experience, published three research reports, and helped to influence legislation in California.</p>

    <p>From October 2017 - January 2018, I led the research effort with data scientist, Eric. Between the both of us, we sought to understand the situation from as many angles as possible:</p>

    <p>Eric and I found a great rhythm of “ping-ponging” between qualitative and quantitative research. Sometimes I would notice a trend in user interviews and would ask Eric if he could identify the severity of the problem through a data investigation. Sometimes Eric’s data analysis would show an issue people were having but couldn’t understand why. As a result, I would talk to a few clients to see if I could understand the reason behind it.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">

    <p>After our research, we asked ourselves, “What can we do to improve our application?”</p>

    <p>The initial inspiration was to learn how assisters at community-based organizations worked. Through helping hundreds of people apply in-person over years, they had learned how to maximize a person’s chance of getting through the process.</p>

    <p>We talked to helpful friends at the SF-Marin Food Bank and the Alameda Food Bank.</p>

    <p>Based on what we learned, I started the process by finding ways to rapidly prototype a better flow.</p>

    <p>The first was a script that I ran through with 10 clients verbally and then following up with them to see if they were approved or denied.</p>

    <p>The second iteration was taking the questions on that script and breaking them into index cards that roughly represented the design.</p>

    <p>The third was a high fidelity index card prototype that I reviewed with the team and with subject matter experts from local food banks.</p>

    <p>At each step, we used feedback from clients and subject matter experts to adjust the language and flow of the application.</p>

    <p>After feeling good about the new redesign, our product manager and I broke the redesign into smaller stories in pivotal tracker that engineers could work on over time.</p>

    <p>Here is the final result of the new application:</p>

<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">

    <p>As of July 2019, over one million Californians have used our service to apply for CalFresh. We help an average of 10,000 people every week.</p>

    <p>Before GetCalFresh, most people never even considered applying by themselves online. Today, California has a plain-language and mobile-friendly way to apply within 10 minutes. The service is designed to educate as much as it is to help them fill out a form.</p>

    <p>Our redesign showed also impact in applications received by counties. We provided more accurate eligibility pre-screening. We measured a 60% increase in verifications submitted. These factors resulted in a 10% increase in application approval rate.</p>

    <p>Because the flow was clearer for clients, it was also clearer for us. This more logical flow through the application has helped make future iterations much easier for our product team.</p>

    <p>Our way of working has also helped to inspire government. The happiest moments are when we hear our government partners adopt terms like user-centric or agile development. We are commonly invited to facilitate workshops to make sure that new legislation is designed with users in mind.</p>

    <p>While the online service is the most visible result of our work, culture change in government is what will bring the most lasting impact.</p>
