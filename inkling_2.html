      <p>From 2011 to 2014, I worked at Inkling, a digital publishing startup in San Francisco. I arrived when it was a 50 person company making custom books for the iPad. When I left, Inkling was an 150 person company building publishing software for clients such as Pearson, Kaplan, and McGraw-Hill.</p>

      <p>In three years, I progressed from designing/coding nearly 50 interactive digital books to building working prototypes of many instrumental tools to managing a team that helped scaled the production of digital books by 100x.</p>

    <h2>Building Books</h2>
    <p><em>When I started at Inkling, I built books.</em> Each project was a tight collaboration between a designer, developer, editor, content architect, and publisher. Working with such small and diverse teams was one of my favorite experiences.</p>
    <h3>Design Work</h3>
    <p><em>Sometimes, I designed books.</em> The challenge was to translate a diverse range of complex print layouts to responsive web layouts that accurately captured the intent of the content. This involved constant communication with the publisher and editor to understand how the book was used and the best way to visually represent that.</p>

    </div>
    <h3>Coding Work</h3>
    <p><em>Usually, I coded books.</em> This mean translating design mocks into HTML/CSS for each type of component in the book - headers, sidenotes, references, introductions, etc. Each book was the equivalent of a complex website and in order to organize our code, we utilized the modularity of SASS. I would work with the design lead to stress-test their layouts against edge cases and make sure that we both understood how the design would flex across different display sizes. We would then work with vendors in India to use this pattern library to digitally recreate every page of the book.</p>

    <h2>Building Tools</h2>
    <p><em>I built web tools in my spare time to solve problems.</em> Working on dozens of book over the first year, I began to wonder whether I could do anything to make the process easier for other team members. What started off as hacking projects ended up becoming incredibly useful tools that are still used internally or were incorporated into Inkling's publisher software, Habitat.</p>
    <h3>Poptip Viewer</h3>

        <figcaption>
          <p>One day, I was watching an editor proof content within glossary poptips. To do so, she scrolled through every page of the book tapping on each term to check if the definition matched. I watched her do this day in and day out and I thought there must be a better way. I spent the next two nights building a tool that visualized every poptip in the book next to the term that it was associated with. This transformed a task that took an entire day to something that took an hour. This feature was so useful that it was eventually incorporated into Habitat.</p>

          <p>Everyone else in the company noticed that proofing content links were similarly tedious. In order to make this process as efficient as possible, I built a tool that allowed editors to traverse between every link in the book. Every time a link was highlighted, a preview of the content it linked to would show up in an adjacent panel. This turned days worth of production work to hours.</p>

          <p>As we began to scale up our library, our service providers in India started taking over more work, including HTML/CSS coding for basic books. Part of our job was to ensure that their code was up to our standards. After many code reviews, I created a tool to help detect potential problems by providing a birdâ€™s eye view of the CSS code and the frequency at how different selectors were used. This helped to detect many issues such as excessive use of important tags, incorrect usage of z-index or absolute positioning, missing browser prefixes, and use of deprecated or experimental CSS selectors.</p>

    <h2>Building a Platform</h2>

    <p><em>I thought about how to define our content as a whole.</em> Inkling started off making books solely for iPad but in 2012 expanded to supporting web, iPhone, and Android devices. I was heavily involved in defining how books would reflow across different devices widths. I also lead the effort to modernize our codebase to support all modern web and android devices.</p>

    <p>In early 2013, Inkling launched Habitat, a publishing platform to allow anyone else to create their own Inkling books. The company began its shift from a content-centric company to a software centric company. Around this time, I was made <em>manager of the Content Platform and Strategy team</em>. As a team, our responsibility shifted from making books ourselves to ensuring others could easily do so.</p>

    <p>Our team focused on three major areas.</p>

    <h3>Inkling Base</h3>
    <p><em>Essentially a Twitter Bootstrap for digital books,</em> Inkling Base allowed publishers to get started creating their books with 90% of the groundwork already done. It included our ever growing pattern library, template HTML pages, and our SASS codebase with responsive layouts, grid systems, and basic typography already built-in.</p>

    <h3>Content Conversions</h3>

    <p>Publishers were eager to begin new projects in Habitat but they also had a huge backlog of titles they wanted to digitize. Our team created flexible SASS design templates as well as custom scripts to convert XML/INDD book files into HTML content. Our team also led the initiative to make our content EPUB3 compatible.</p>

    <p><em>Our team led the project to help Elsevier digitize over 700 titles within half a year.</em> Having never produced more than 50 books at a time previously, this was a huge achievement for the company.</p>

    <h3>New Content Capabilities</h3>

    <p>We also focused on collaborating with the engineering teams to enable new capabilities such as LaTeX equation authoring, semantic markup and enrichment (RDFa and Microdata), and incorporating custom javascript widgets.</p>

      <h2>Testimonials</h2>
      <p>While my three years at Inkling has strengthened me as a designer, developer, and manager, the greatest reward was getting to work with the diverse and talented people around me. It goes without saying that all of these accomplishments were in close collaboration with co-workers in the design, engineering, product, operations, and content teams. I am glad to say that many still remain as good friends.</p>
