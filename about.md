        <p><em>My name is Norris and design is how I choose to make the world a better place.</em> I strive to make products more usable and content more understandable by being the advocate for the user. I have a special enthuasiasm for design thinking, typography, information design, and web development.</p>
        <p>Most recently, I thru-hiked from Mexico to Canada on the Pacific Crest Trail.</p>
        <p>From 2011-2014, I was at Inkling where I led a team of designers and developers in reimagining the textbook in the digital form and worked with publishers to create those books for themselves.</p>
        <p>Sometimes I like to work on side projects such as Mindshare, an app that helps you to discover what your friends enjoy reading.</p>
        <p>Previously, I was a designer at Seedling Projects and freelanced under the name Dual Aesthetic.</p>
        <p>I studied at Brown University and took classes at the Rhode Island School of Design. After graduating, I spent five months in Patagonia backpacking and volunteering on organic farms.</p>
