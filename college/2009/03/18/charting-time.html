    <p>In the final project of Information Design at RISD with Krzysztof Lenk, we were asked to keep track of how we used our time each day for roughly three months. The goal of the project was to present the information in a meaningful way – however we decided that would be.</p>

<p>I believed that meaningful design of information can be used to to either convey a point or to tell a story. Seeing as the information was very personal, I was more interested in using the it to tell a story. I soon realized there exist many stories even in a single life over a short period of three months. Instead of trying to melt all the information into one graph, I thought I would let each part of my life tell its own story.</p>

<p>I split my time up into separate stories – school, research, social life, planning my future, etc. I kept track of not only the time I spent on each part of my life but important events as well so that I could put the time spent in context. Also, I realized what makes interesting stories is not what usually happens but things out of the norm. Therefore, I wrote a computer program to change the opacity of the bars so that the more the amount of time I spent on something varied from the average, the more vibrantly it would appear on the page. This way, the reader’s eyes automatically look for the more interesting stories.</p>

<p>Ballons on top represent individual events that help to explain why I spent more or less time on a certain part of my life.</p>
