    <h2>Building Content</h2>
    <p>For the first year and a half, I built interactive digital content for the Inkling platform. Each digital book was a tight collaboration between a content architect, a technical lead, a design lead, an editorial lead, the publisher, and a production team in India.</p>

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>My role as a design lead was to translate a diverse range of complex print layouts to responsive web layouts that accurately captured the intent of the content. Working with media rich text allowed me to refine my typography skills in establishing type hierachies, balanced page templates, and flexible grid structures.</p>
        <p>Our continual goal was the push the envelope of what beautiful digital content could be.</p>

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>As a tech lead, I would translate design mocks into HTML/CSS. Since every book we built was essentially a complex website with dozens of page templates and commonly reused patterns, utilizing the power of SASS partials, variables, and mixins was crucial. I would work with the design lead to stress-test their layouts and make sure that we both understood how the design would respond across different devices.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, I would also work on custom embedded JavaScript widgets on high-touch titles.</p>

    <h2>Building Tools</h2>
    <p><em>I built web tools in my spare time to solve problems.</em> Working on dozens of book over the first year, I began to wonder whether I could do anything to make the process easier for other team members. What started off as hacking projects ended up becoming incredibly useful tools still used in the compnay today.</p>

        <h3>Poptip Viewer</h3>
        <p>Poptip viewer is a tool that visualized every poptip (think interactive footnotes) in the book next to the term that it was associated with. This transformed a task that took an entire day to sometime that took less than an hour. This feature was so useful that it was eventually incorporated into Habitat, Inkling’s publishing software.</p>

        <h3>Traverser</h3>
        <p>Traverser is a tool that allowed editors to quickly find and check every link in the book. Every time a link was highlighted, a preview of the content it linked to would show up in an adjacent panel. Users could then quickly navigate between links using keyboard shortcuts. This turned days worth of work to hours.</p>

        <h3>Sassafras</h3>
        <p>Sassafrass is a tool to help detect potential problems by providing a bird’s eye view of the CSS code and the frequency at how different selectors were used. This helped to detect many issues in third-party code such as excessive use of important tags, incorrect usage of z-index or absolute positioning, missing browser prefixes, and use of deprecated or experimental CSS selectors. Users could then tap into the specifical SASS partial in order to address the issue.</p>

    <h2>Building a Platform</h2>
    <p>In early 2013, Inkling launched Habitat, a publishing platform to allow anyone else to create their own Inkling books. I led the Content Platform and Strategy team to ensure outside content developers could easily build the content they wanted within our platform.</p>
    <section class="sub-section">
      <section class="content">
        <h3>Inkling Base</h3>
        <p>Essentially a Twitter Bootstrap for digital books, Inkling Base allowed publishers to get started creating their books with 90% of the groundwork already done. It included our ever growing pattern library, template HTML pages, and our SASS codebase with responsive layouts, grid systems, and basic typography already built-in.</p>

        <h3>Content Conversions</h3>
        <p>Publishers were eager to begin new projects in Habitat but they also had a huge backlog of titles they wanted to digitize. Our team created flexible SASS design templates as well as custom scripts to convert XML/INDD book files into HTML content. Our team also led the initiative to make our content EPUB3 compatible.</p>
        <p>As one example, our team led the project to help Elsevier digitize over 700 titles within half a year. Having never produced more than 50 books at a time previously, this was a huge achievement for the company. What partially enabled this was producing a single flexible front-end template that utilized SASS variables to easily customize the look of every each book. It also involved closely studying their XML content structure and writing a script that reliably outputted the desired HTML structure.</p>

        <h3>New Content Capabilities</h3>
        <p>Another part of the responsibility of our team was to make sure our content utilized the latest web standards to achieve features that our clients needed. We constantly collaborated with the engineering teams to enable new capabilities such as LaTeX equation authoring, semantic markup and enrichment (RDFa and Microdata), structured search, and custom interactive JavaScript widgets.</p>
